## Hi there 👋

If you have found this page, you're early to party. This is very much a work of curiosity, more than anything. However, I feel it is starting to grow legs. 

## What is it?

I was surprised to find not only was there nothing similar to Tauri for C++ (especially considering WebView is a C library), but also surprised to find a lack of modern C++ GUI frameworks in general. 

Therefore, this project started from a simple question, with complex implications. 

> "How would you even start to build something like Tauri?"

And just like that I embarked on a journey to see just how far the rabbit hole goes. 

## Is this a Tauri clone?

This project is inspired by Tauri, but built from the ground up in C++. 

I am trying to create much of the same initialisation/development/build approaches adopted by Tauri, but I am just building them as I see them so they will be far from the same. 


## More to come!

I will add more here as I get to it. For now I am just following my curiosity with this project and seeing where it goes.
